Anxiety is too high, the situation is too complex, or it has been too long since we've graced God's doorstep to piece together a conversation. There are several prayer practices that can address this common experience, like silence, or allowing the Spirit to \"intercede for us with groanings too deep for words\" (Romans 8:26). Breath Prayer is another helpful practice when our being longs to commune with God, but we need help doing so.",  "creator": "Dr. Tiffany Dahlman", "thumbnail": "/blog_breathprayerformation.jpg", "url": "https://acu-cdn-pull.b-cdn.net/breathe.mp4" , "blog": "<p>In the season of Advent, there are four themes-hope, peace, joy and love.
